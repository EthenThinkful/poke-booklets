# PokemonAPIject
## Goal at Hand
Incorporate different Pokemon APIs centered around the idea to help a person create a personalized Poke card booklet to store cards.

## Plan
1.) Build a RESTful API & database for the user <br />
2.) Clean up functionality of the Poke card booklet (e.g. animation for page flips, using the PokeAPI for design on the front and back of card booklet) <br />
3.) Be C R E A T I V E... & fun

### Tech
This project uses Vite, React, NPM, Draggable, Tailwind CSS (& CSS3), Axios, & the Pokemon TCG API SDK.
