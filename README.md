# Poke Booklets
This project was primarily created to engage in a full-stack development project utilizing Java on the backend while making something I'm passionate about.

## What exists
- Retrieve any card that exists and every version of it.
- Add 6 cards to a personalized booklet page to create your own party and check out what others have created in the meantime.

## Plan
1.) Expand on backend functionality 
3.) Incorporate better error handling
2.) Brainstorm ideas for evolving the site 

## Tech
This project primarily uses Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.
